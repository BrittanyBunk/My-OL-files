jq - like sed for JSON data, slice and filter and map and transform structured data with the same ease that sed, awk, grep, etc.

cd ~
mkdir bin
cd bin
explorer .
paste the file in here, and rename it to jq.exe
this will create a directory called bin inside your home directory ( ~ ), and place the jq.exe file in there
special directory; git bash will let you reference any .exe files in here from anywhere
So then you'll be able to run jq from anywhere, and it will call this .exe file
go to the home directory: cd ~
and run jq --version
head dumpfile.txt | cut -f5 <-rename dumpfile to the one from the OL
- gives you the first 10 lines, but only the 5th column
go to the folder to access it
- use quotes if the file name has a space
head dumpfile.txt | cut -f5 | clip
clip - copies results onto your clipboard
it does look like it took out the the first 2 columns
jq website go to "try it online" https://stedolan.github.io/jq/
paste the results into the big window where it says "JSON"
to run, type inti the "Filter" section: [.title, .number_of_pages] | @csv
Run the command in gitbash first
that will get the first 10 lines of JSON
and copy them to your clipboard
Then paste those 10 lines into the website
it didn't do anything when I ran head editions.txt | cut -f5
pipe it - > editionsnewcolumns.csv
use emeditor
