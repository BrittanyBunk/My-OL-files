# OL-and-IA-community files

Personal files from the community for collaboration with the Open Library and Internet Archive on various projects. Could be project files, tips, archived discussions, etc. from the community about what they know, did, and can teach others to create an archive of the community's work.

Two reasons for its existence:
1) it's creation was to put my files for projects I was collaborating with others on for the Open Library
2) To publish my work on projects that are in progress with the Open Library that can be a benefit to the public before the projects are done.

The series folder is to form the basis for creating a series layer on the OpenLibrary due to the need for it: 
Right now it's work and edition, but after work comes series. Later, after series would be 'universe', but that's a later step.

The data dump folder are how to do a mass results of searches on the OpenLibrary data dumps. 
Note: anyone can follow my instructions to do a mass search result!
Part 1 are for geting the rows and Part 2 is for the columns.
This helps out massively on mass-editing of the Open Library if desired. 
It's best to either create a bot to handle the errors or leave it alone. 
Manually mass-editing's not a good idea, because it's tedious and also might make it harder to find bot errors and correct them. 
Those errors are going to be there on purpose until fixed.

About in-progress projects:
The Open Library has difficulties working on UI/Design for their website. So the topic of most of the pre-project works will be on that: UI/web design.
