for the Open Library

The series folder is to form the basis for creating a series layer on the OpenLibrary due to the need for it: 
Right now it's work and edition, but after work comes series. Later, after series would be 'universe', but that's a later step.

The data dump folder are how to do a mass results of searches on the OpenLibrary data dumps. 
Note: anyone can follow my instructions to do a mass search result!
Part 1 are for geting the rows and Part 2 is for the columns.
This helps out massively on mass-editing of the Open Library if desired. 
It's best to either create a bot to handle the errors or leave it alone. 
Manually mass-editing's not a good idea, because it's tedious and also might make it harder to find bot errors and correct them. 
Those errors are going to be there on purpose until fixed.
